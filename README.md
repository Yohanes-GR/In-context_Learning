# In-Context Learning
In-context learning is a mysterious emergent behavior in large language models (LMs) where the LM performs a task just by conditioning on input-output examples, without optimizing any parameters
# overview
This repository is used for week 4 challenge of 10Academy. The instructions for this project can be found in the challenge document.

Large Language Models coupled with multiple AI capabilities are able to generate images and text, and also approach/achieve human level performance on a number of tasks. The world is going through a revolution in art (DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagine, etc.), science (AlphaFold), medicine, and other key areas, and this approach is playing a role in this revolution.
